Habitat suitability modeling is a technique used to predict the most favorable environments for particular species, such as bats, based on specific ecological and geographical criteria. This process starts by collecting and analysing data on locations where the species has been recorded and examining factors such as vegetation type, proximity to water sources, elevation, topography, and climate conditions. These data are then used to build a statistical model of the species' habitat preferences. The model extrapolates the preferences across a broader area, giving a detailed map of relative high and low predicted suitability. This mapping can be used as a guide for impact assessment and conservation planning, highlighting areas that support important habitat for the species.
